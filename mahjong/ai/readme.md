# Write a strategy to play card with given hands. 
The first version is to write a All-out attack strategy.

The second version is to use CNN model to predicate the best cart with which player will have the max win rate

I calculated the number of hands patterns and the result is 1113207.The method is to calculate C(72,14)/(4^14)
